# AwesomeApp | Connect Udacity Nanodegree Students Together
AwesomeApp is a Mobile & WebApp to connect Udacity Nanodegree Students together based on their Preferences.

## How it works?
Each Udacity Nanodegree Student will login and set his/her Preferences, and start exploring another classmate who is working on the same project, and start working together!

## What are the Preferences?
It includes:
- Slack Name
- Nanodegree Track
- Current Project
- Preferred Language #1
- Preferred Language #2

## When can I join?
The WebApplication isn't ready yet, but I am doing my best to make it happen as soon as possible!
